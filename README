Merge patch workflow - README

1) Run:
   python3 generate_patch_stubs.py /mnt/data/science_diff.txt
   -> This will generate stubs in ./patches/ (one stub per diff header).

2) Open each stub (./patches/*.patch.stub.txt) and create a focused patch:
   - Edit the accompanying .patch file in ./patches/ and place a valid git unified diff.
   - Keep patches small and focused (one logical change each).

3) (Optional) For common renames, inspect scripts in ./sed_patches/ and run them in a feature branch:
   ./sed_patches/timestep_len_to_timestep.sh

4) Apply patches:
   From the repo root run:
   ./apply_patches.sh         # creates local branches and commits
   or
   ./apply_patches.sh --push  # also pushes branches to origin

5) For each created branch:
   - Build locally (use strict Fortran flags)
   - Run single column / short test runs
   - Fix remaining interface mismatches manually and update the patch

6) When tests are OK:
   - Push branch (if not pushed)
   - Create PR per branch, explain context and tests performed
