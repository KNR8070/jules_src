INSTRUCTIONS:
  1) Edit the corresponding .patch file: patches/diff_-r_vn7.0copy1_c4_src_._initialisation_standalone_init_soil_biogeochem_mod.F90_vn7.6_vcmax-jmax-diurnal_knr_24Nov_src_._initialisation_standalone_init_soil_biogeochem_mod.F90.patch
     - Place a git-style unified diff (``--- a/..., +++ b/...``) there.
  2) Create small focused patches (one logical change per file).
  3) Run apply_patches.sh (after filling patches) from the repository root.
